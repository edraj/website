A new release installs over the old one, keeps `config.env` and the data, and brings the database up to date itself when it starts.

## Before you upgrade

- **Back up.** On SQLite, copy the database file (`/var/lib/dmart/dmart.db` for the packages) while the service is stopped; on PostgreSQL, take a `pg_dump`. [`dmart export`](/cli#5-export) also writes each space out as files.
- **Several nodes** sharing one PostgreSQL database are upgraded together; see [Running several nodes](/technical#running-several-nodes).

## Upgrading

A package upgrade does not restart the service, so restart it yourself:

```bash
sudo dnf upgrade dmart && sudo systemctl restart dmart
sudo apt update && sudo apt install --only-upgrade dmart && sudo systemctl restart dmart
sudo apk upgrade dmart && sudo rc-service dmart restart
```

- **What the package keeps:** `/etc/dmart/config.env` is written on the first install only, so your edits stay; the unit file is replaced, so keep your changes in a drop-in (see [The packaged service](/installation#the-packaged-service)).
- **The container:** pull the new tag and start a new container on the same `/root/.dmart` volume.
- **A tarball:** replace the binary (and, on the glibc builds, the libraries beside it) and restart the server.
- **At its first start,** the new version runs schema initialization, the search-text fill and any one-time `query_policies` rewrite the release brings. On PostgreSQL several nodes take turns at these; see [Running several nodes](/technical#running-several-nodes), which also covers rolling back.
- **The repositories** carry the five most recent releases.
